# P4Ruby
P4Ruby is a wrapper for the P4 C++ API in Ruby.

P4Ruby is a Ruby module that provides an object-oriented API to Helix Core server. Using P4Ruby is faster than using the command-line interface in scripts, because multiple command can be executed on a single connection, and because it returns Helix server responses as Ruby hashes and arrays.

## Requirements
For P4Ruby requirements see "Compatibility Statements" in [RELNOTES](https://github.com/perforce/p4ruby/blob/master/RELNOTES.txt#L99)

## Documentation
Official documentation is located on the [Perforce website](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/p4ruby/Content/P4Ruby/Home-p4ruby.html)
